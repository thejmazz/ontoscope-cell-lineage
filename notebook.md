# Notebook

**2016/04/06**

- init repo, wiki page
- set an hour for investigating the questions
  - what are the primary human cell lineages?
  - where can we get data for them?
  - look into hematopoietic cell lineage
- some questions for the future
  - how many cell lineages represented in COdat?
  - how to separate cell lineages in COdat?
- there is [The Human Cell Lineage Flagship Initiative](http://www.lineage-flagship.eu/)
  - has not been updated since 2010
  - fertilized egg as root, extant cells as leaves, branches as cell divisions
  - cell lineage of *C. elegans* known
  - structure+dynamics of cell lineage in **development**, **growth**, **renewal**, **aging**, **disease**
  - diseases such as **cancer**, **auto-immune diseases**, **diabetes**, **neuro-degenerative**, **cardiovascular**, **rare inherited**
  - cells with similar **signatures** should reside close to each other in the cell lineage tree
  - if it is $1000 for whole genome sequencing, will be $100 000 000 000 000 000 for the entire cell lineage
  - but fraction of each genome is enough
  - [Presentation](http://www.lineage-flagship.eu/lineage/uploads/file/FlagshipLineage_v3.pdf)
  - [TEDxTelAviv - Ehud Shapiro - Uncovering the Human Cell lineage tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Tm6Vqi38JGk) *(to watch)*
  - [Reconstruction of Cell Lineage Trees in Mice](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001939) *(to read)*
  - [more papers](http://www.lineage-flagship.eu/index.php?page_name=background)
  - [people](http://www.lineage-flagship.eu/index.php?page_name=people) - from UofT, [John Dick](https://oicr.on.ca/person/oicr-investigator/john-dick) working on 'Hematopoietic and immune system'
  - looked for more recent papers on cell lineages from Shapiro
    - [Comparing Algorithms That Reconstruct Cell Lineage Trees Utilizing Information on Microsatellite Mutations](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003297) *(to read)*
- [Stem cell lineage database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_lineage_database)
- [Cell Lineage Analysis in Human Brain Using Endogenous Retroelements](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627314011374) *(to read)*
- [KEGG - Hematopoietic cell lineage](http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa04640+3815)

TODOs for next session:
- look more into hematopoietic research, recent papers by John Dick?
- does KEGG have other cell lineages?
- which are the most studied human cell lineages?
- read Comparing Algs. That Reconstruct Cell Lineage Trees paper
